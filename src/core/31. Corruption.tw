Sweat drips down your brow as your sprint through the barren halls of the witch's lair.

You cry out to her over and over, but even as your voice goes hoarse, Lily is nowhere to be seen. Minions of the witch spot you easily, but the most you spare them is a croaked-out incantation and a quick glare. You run out of breath as you reach the innermost sanctum, where your allies first beat the retreat that barely saved your lives. Your lungs burn, and the adrenaline propelling you forward has all but run out. You slink down against the nearest wall.

Then, you hear a familiar voice, and tears rush straight to your eyes.

"Iris?!" From a hidden alcove just around the corner, Lily emerges and charges to your side. "Are you hurt?" She kneels beside you, and you're tempted to slap her. Instead, you shake your head.

"Just exhausted. What the hell were you thinking running back in here?" She sinks and stares at the floor, before finally stammering out.

"I-I left something behind... If I left without it, I knew we'd be in serious trouble." When you only glare her way, she continues. "Fine! I dropped my Holy Symbol in the struggle and came back for it." You curse.

Then, you take her hand in yours and squeeze it tight.

"That thing isn't worth your life. We're getting out of here now!" You try to push yourself up to your feet, only for your legs to buckle at the knees. Lily supports you at the shoulder and guides you to a standing position, but pushing yourself forward proves a colossal task.

With horrific timing, you hear a familiar cackling echo through the halls, and you start to panic. Lily doesn't seem to share your worry. You stagger towards the exit, but she just stays put and frowns. You yank on her arm.

"Come on! We don't have much time..." You legs give out again, and it's all you can do to lean against the wall and pull yourself forward. Lily, on the other hand, strides forwards and stands in front of you, where she takes both of your hands between hers. She smiles at you.

"You worry too much, Iris. It's all going to be okay soon." Your eyes go wide. You start to yell at her when she squeezes your hands tight... and you hear a sharp, metallic click.

Lily steps back, and you realize she's bound your wrists together in a tight pair of manacles. Instinct takes over, and you reach to your side, clutching at your Arcane Focus. Your hands slap against the bare metal of your breastplate. Only then do you see the awful grin across Lily's face as she twirls your focus between her fingers. You charge towards her, making it all of a few feet before you collapse face-first onto the grimy floor.

She crouches at your side and casually flings your last hope to the side, where it shatters against the far wall.

"Honestly... you need to be more careful, Iris. Lady Agares will be here soon, and she'll be upset if you've managed to hurt yourself." Lily carefully dotes over you, tidying your hair and wiping mud from your face as you desperately fight against your restraints.

Deep down, you've already realized it's hopeless. As she circles around to lock your ankles in another set of manacles, you start to cry. She watches you with a believable sense of pity, but you're not sure what you can believe anymore. It's the most you can do to whimper out one question.

"What did she do to you...?"

Lily frowns down at you... then shakes her head.

"Nothing at all. Lady Agares only had to show me the light, and then I knew." She sighs and crouches down beside you.

"It was for the best. I'm free now! And... with her help... you can be, too."

That awful cackling only grows louder and louder, while Lily sits contented at your side and brushes your hair.

[[And then...|31Hub]]

:: 31Captured [Blood]

You awake, still manacled, in an unfamiliar, dimly lit room.

With a quick glance you can see the totality of the filthy room, and you realize that your side of it is encased in a large, metal cage. The other side is strewn with papers and ritual implements which you shudder to see. Then, a figures steps in through the door, and you glower, hackles raised. The witch cackles.

"It seems that no introductions are needed, my pet. But, feel free to address me as 'Lady Agares', 'my queen', 'mistress'... whatever calls to you." Her smug expression sets you off immediately, and a growl rises up in your throat.

"I don't give a fuck who you are. If I have to break out of here and wring your neck to save Lily, I'll make it happen." This only sets her laughing again.

"Oh... I love the willful ones so much. I'm glad that girl recommended you." You raise an eyebrow her way, but she waves it off. "Well... we might as well get started while we wait for her."

She surveys the room around her then gets to work righting the ritual components around the rooms edge, directing them all back towards your cage. You can't make heads or tails of their purpose, but they set you on edge. The witch casually chats with you while she works.

"Whoever sent you after my head must have told you that I worship Osmodai. Am I right to assume that?" You grunt, which she takes as an affirmative and continues. "Well, it's been a busy season for the archfiend who brokers my connection, and it falls to me to dig up new recruits." She turns and fixes you with an awful sneer.

"As I give nothing but my best to the All-Mother, I've developed the perfect method for turning this world's creatures to Her embrace. But, I hardly need to explain it, seeing as you've already witnessed my latest work in action." A chill runs down your spine, and she sets off cackling again.

You grind your teeth as you watch her. Part of you wants to charge helplessly at the bars of your cage, but you hold it back. Right now, bound and disarmed, you're totally at her mercy, and if anything happens to you... you can only imagine what would become of Lily.

The witch levels a perverse grin your way.

"Still... a natural-born sorcerer... it's been years since I've received such an interesting toy." She steps closer to examine you, and you bare your teeth at her to no avail. "You might last a little longer than the others, but..." Then, with only a moment's consideration, she stands tall and nods.

"Four days. By the next full moon, I'll have you mewling like a kitten for me." In spite of yourself, you blush. No matter how hard you try to hide from her, your new cage leaves you pitifully exposed from all angles.

Agares sets off again with that mocking laugh, only to be cut off by a sound at the door. When the witch goes quiet, you turn back around and... you see her.

Lily stands in the doorway, having swapped her armor for a cropped gown, covered top-to-bottom in black lace couture. In all your years together, you've never seen her in something so daring. The witch seems to share your impression of her, but rather than hide her face, she openly licks her lips.

"Sweet //Seire//... you clean up nicer than I expected. Are you here to see the new pet?" She steps to the side, giving the two of you a clear view of one another. Lily flushes when she sees you, but she shakes it off and faces the witch.

"Yes, Lady Agares. I have the garments you requested." The witch nods, then Lily adds on. "I've also been told to inform you of a commotion on the second level's west wing. Your lieutenant requests your judgement as soon as possible."

The witch groans, then turns to study you a moment longer. She sighs.

"It seems playtime will have to wait until the morning, pet." When you roll your eyes, she adds. "Don't look to eager. I'm sure Seire here would be all too happy to start you off with a trial of Lust." Lily stammers something at her, but you tune it out. Then, it's just you and Lily in the room.

She crosses over towards your cage, where she watches you silently. You're glad she's okay... but looking at her right now isn't easy. While you're busy pouting, she opens the door to your cage and tucks the key back under her dress. Lily crouches at your side and whispers down to you.

"Iris..." She reaches out and touches your shoulder, and you jump. She wilts before starting again. "I know this will be hard on you. I'm sorry for that... butâ€”" You whirl around towards her, and you swell and...

You turn away and sigh. Lily inches closer, and your instincts scream for you to dive straight into her chest and cry your heart out. Instead, you hold all that energy inside you and grind your teeth. The most you can manage is a whisper.

"I don't know what the witch did to you, but... the Lily I know would never do any of this."

(She accepts that iris is having trouble and leaves her with her dress)

It's the first morning of your new life here, locked in this filthy cage. 'Agares' says she has a plan for you. Even if you don't believe a word of it, you'll need to make it through her games if you want a chance at saving Lily from whatever has come over her. For the first time in a long time, your head is clear, and you feel a sense of purpose.

The witch approaches, and she slides a sheet of yellowed paper just beyond your cage's bars. On it are neat, academic notes, terminating in a chart with seven steps. She starts.

"Good morning, my pet. Are you excited to start testing?" You roll your eyes, and she titters. "Well, it's the only way you'll be getting supper, so I think you'll come to like it soon." Your stomach rumbles in response. The thought of a hunger strike has come to you, but you'll need your full fighting strength to stand a chance at escape. You peruse the options laid out before you, more to soothe yourself than to glean any deeper understanding.

Without giving it too much thought, you make your first choice and slide the paper back to Agares.
\<<ctpNext clear>>\
It's your first evening in the cage. Lily comes around to bring you some bread crusts and warm soup. The two of you are able to chat for a bit through the bars of your cage, but she's insistent that all of this is what she wanted and that she thinks you should want it too. You can't bear to hear her like that, so you tune it all out...

When she leaves, Lily smiles back at you, and Agares enters sneering in her wake.

"Looks like you enjoyed the food. Well, hardly a better time to keep training, is there?" You groan and kick your bowl against the cage's wall.

"I'm already sick of this. Whatever spell you put on Lily, she'll break it soon, and we'll cut your throat before we leave this place."

The witch laughs.

"Oh please, it hardly takes magic to turn a girl like my //Seire//. Hells, I didn't even have to put her through my program." You turn away, but she steps in closer to gloat.

"All it took was one whisper, and she was ready to renounce it all. I'd tell you what I told her, but... I think you already know, don't you?" She pulls in close and grins at you, then she jumps back and curses when you kick at the bars of your cage. A dull ache spreads up from your foot, and you grit your teeth to deny her the satisfaction of your pain.

"I swear, I've never seen such a disobedient mutt in my life. It'll be so satisfying to finally break you..."

With that, she slips you the same notes from this morning and watches in perverse excitement as you weigh your options.
\<<ctpNext clear>>\
You hardly believe it without sight of the sun, but you've reached your second morning in the cage.

Lily comes by again, this time with a thin, diluted salt pork stew to hold you over. You're tempted to throw the food back in her face, strike her, anything to provoke a reaction that might bring her back to her senses... instead, you quietly eat, and she holds your hand through your meal slot. She rubs small circles into your palm and watches you eat.

"This would all be over if you just listened to Lady Agares, you know...?" Her gaze is soft, genuine, and it makes you shudder. When you were kids, you always got into fights over the dumbest things, and she'd give you that exact look. Sweet... consoling... pure... you can't believe that girl could ever be tainted like this.

You shake your head.

"I'll kill her. I could never forgive what she's done to you..." Lily groans and pulls her hand away.

"Am I not allowed to change? Or are you more invested in some stupid, dead dragon than what I want?!" She turns away from your cage and pouts. You try reaching to her through the bars, but she ignores you.

The two of you sit in silence. You wolf down what's left of your food, then you sigh.

"I'm sorry... but I can't forgive her." Lily hugs her legs, and you continue.

"Even if Agares hasn't brainwashed you, she's manipulating you to her ends! She only //wants// the version of you that obeys her!" She stands then turns to you, glowering and teary-eyed. You fall silent.

Then, she whispers to you, her voice weak but full of vitriol.

"I know." She takes in a deep breath, clearly holding back a sob... then she sighs. "She's not that different from you, in that regard..."

Then, Lily walks out of view. 

Agares comes in soon after, but she stays quiet. For a witch, she has a strange sense of social propriety. She doesn't have to remind you of your options at this point, so she waits quietly while you decide.

The bitter silence gives you too much space to think about Lily's words, so you spit at Agares and throw barbs her way until she goes back to her normal, cocky self. You feel much more at ease making your choice with her sneering your way.
\<<ctpNext clear>>\
Lily doesn't come this evening, instead Agares has a stout, skeletal minion bring you your supper. It's not very talkative, which gives you some time to think.

If what the witch told you was right, this evening is the halfway point between your arrival and your total transformation. You steel yourself and take stock of your surroundings. Not much has changed in the sleek stone room, but... you spot ''one'' thing.

Atop a hanging scroll on a nearby table, you can make out the weathered edges of an arcane focus, presumably left there by the witch. If you reach out with your cuffed hands, you should be able to yank the scroll down and drop the focus within reach of your cage. Still... it could be a trap.

You'll have to decide for yourself when the right time for an escape is. You could go right to it and risk getting caught... but playing along with Agares's games could provide you with a better opportunity...

When the witch comes by to hear your choice, you do what you think is right.
\<<ctpNext clear>>\
As soon as you hear her footsteps, you shoot up. <<addclass "#tortOptions" "hide">>

There, in the room's center, is $v31_Name. When your eyes meet, she gives you a shy smile, before sliding a meal into your cage. You ignore it to watch her as she crouches down and sits across from you.

"It'll be a while before Agares comes. Shall we talk?" You nod, and she settles in. "You probably have a lot of questions... go ahead and ask."

Without a second of thought, you go straight to your main concern.

"Why? Why do all of this?" $v31_Name shuffles around where she sits. Rather than wait for an answer you know will be evasive, you shift tactics.

"Is Agares threatening you?" She shakes her head. "Is she offering you something in exchange for this?" Another no. "Then, did I do something to hurt you?" She sits still for a moment... then she whispers.

"No. Never. Or... nothing I could blame you for, at least..." $v31_Name meets your gaze... then she sighs.

"I'm sorry... Osmodai says we're supposed to be honest about our wants, but..." She reaches through the bars and takes your cuffed hand in hers. Then she squeezes it softly, almost imperceptibly so. "I'm having a hard time unlearning what they taught me in seminary."

You massage $v31_Name's hand between yours. Once the initial frustration washes over you... it leaves something else behind... and you realize you can accept this part of her. Something sets in place within your heart... and you smile at her.

"Alright. I can live with that." $v31_Name's eyes widen... then she leans against your cage and grins. While she's off-guard, you pull in and kiss her on the cheek. You both giggle... and a thought comes into your head.

"Then... if we understand one another... What are we going to do about Agares?"

She sighs.

"I'm conflicted. She's helped me break away from Nekheziel's dogma, but... Well, it's not my place to judge her for what she's done to you." $v31_Name grinds her teeth, and you get a feeling how she //would// judge Agares given the chance.

"If you wanted to stay for some reason, I'd stay beside you. If you choose to leave, I'll fight at your side as well as I can in this state." She rests on her hands and watches you.

"What do you think? What is it that you want, Iris?"

You swallow. Even with all the alone time in your cell between tests and meals, you haven't put much thought into it. You've been working under the assumption your only option is to grab $v31_Name and run. Still... it might be worth some consideration.
<span id="5_fakechoice">
<<linkappend "\"None of her tests have been too harsh. Maybe she'll let us go if they all fail?\"">> $v31_Name laughs.
<<if $v31_Attune < 100>>"Sorry... but I don't think we should rely on that. Agares has a terrifying dedication to this project. If you disprove her hypothesis, that'll only make her want to test you more." You groan.<<else>>"Sorry... but I think they've already done their job.

"You don't have to go through all that for me, but if you really want to..." She coughs. "Just... signal for me if you change your mind, and I'll come running. Understood?" You nod, and not long after, Agares steps in to see the two of you chatting idly. <<removeclass "#tortOptions" "hide">>

"Understood. I doubt we'll get out without a fight, so I'll do what I can to prepare. Whenever you're ready, give me our old signal."

You take one look towards the Arcane Focus you spotted, and you lunge towards it.

<<set $v31_didLust to true>>\
$v31_Name steps into the room, face flushed and wearing a new, quite short, dress. 

You avert your eyes, trying desperately to avoid leering at her. <<if $v31_Day == 3>> But... something more important weighs on your mind.

<<include [[31IncludePart3]]>> Agares watches from the edge of the room, and she nods.\
<<elseif $v31_Day == 4>> But... she pushes back her embarrassment and addresses you dead-on.

<<include [[31IncludePart4]]>> Agares insists that it must.\
<<else>>Agares arrives behind her, and you grit your teeth in hopes she won't sense your embarrassment. From the way she smirks at you, you're sure she knows.<</if>>

Then, the witch steps up to the bars of your cage and begins.

"For $v31_today's research, you'll be undertaking a trial of Lust, my pet." She smirks. "I could explain it... but something tells me you chose this because you already knew what it entailed..." You want to snarl back and deny her right now... but you can't bear to look her in the eye. When you don't respond, $v31_Name shifts around where she stands.

The witch sneers <<if not $v31_TrueEnvy>>in faux-adoration.

"How cute... Two sweethearts from childhood finally progressing their relationship, all under Osmodai's guiding light? I might have to stay and watch..." You blush and look to $v31_Name, who seems just as embarrassed as you. Agares looks intent to follow through, until $v31_Name huffs and pushes her out the door, slamming it shuts as she goes.
\<<else>>.

"What a shame, though... I thought this could be a nice, romantic first time for you both." You grind your teeth, and another burst of awful, selfish envy comes over you. Agares delights in it. <<set $v31_Attune += 10>>

"Well, I'd love to stick around and give you some pointers, puppy... but I have work to do." With that, she steps out and shuts the door.<</if>>

Once it's just the two of you, the room goes quiet. A flustered $v31_Name inches across the room before kneeling your cage door. She swiftly unlocks your cage and slips inside, only to freeze up and stare at her feet. You can't move to her side while you're restrained like this, so you just whisper her way.

"$v31_Name... We don't have to do anything, if you're worried about that. Agares isn't here to pressure you into anything." She looks your way, then blushes. You're immediately tempted to tease her, but... even you're not that cruel. You open your arms at the elbows, and she leaps straight into your embrace, hiding her cute, embarrassed face in your neck.

$v31_Name is still perfectly soft, and she melts where your bound hands touch her waist. There's a scent of pine around her, masked by several layers of flowery perfume. Logically, it means Agares is letting her move around outside... but instead your mind goes to the woods around your hometown, where the two of you would sneak into one another's tents as kids.

Then, she drops down and leans against your chest. You blush and sit perfectly still... even the rising and falling of your chest with your breathing feels lewd under these circumstances. When $v31_Name looks up at you with a shy smile... you shudder. She laughs at that.

"Somehow... I was worried I wouldn't get your heart racing, Iris..." She nestles into the curve of your shoulder with the biggest, dumbest grin. "We're really the same, aren't we?" You try to hide your blushing face, to no avail. Backed into a corner, you stammer out.

"W-well how couldn't I be?!" This seems to shock her, but you can only continue. "I've been holding back for so many years, and now Agares wants us toâ€”" You stop. $v31_Name's eyes light up, and she levels out with you, inches from your face. You try to walk it back, or defend yourself, but it all comes out as useless blubbering. Then, she leans in and presses a gentle, giggling kiss to your lips.

She steals another and a third, then she looks at you with a gutwrenching, desperate expression, and <<if $v31_LastSession == "Greed">>you're not sure if it's $v31_yesterday's wine at work, but <<set $v31_Attune += 5>><</if>>you know you'll do something unforgivable if she doesn't stop you. $v31_Name only manages a tiny, gasping whisper your way.

"I need you, Iris... Please don't deny me that..."

<span id="options">\
<<link "\"I feel the same... but I can't help you throw away your oath like that...\"">><<replace "#options">><<set $v31_Attune += 5>>\
"I feel the same... but I can't help you throw away your oath like that..." She leans in to kiss you anyway, and it takes everything in you to pull back. She freezes up... then seems to realize herself, falling back and slipping out from your arms.

The two of you sit in strained silence, until $v31_Name looks back your way with tears in her eyes. Her voice is broken and weak.

"Why...?" You sigh, and she advances towards you, on shaky hands and knees. "You have no loyalty to anyone in that cult, you claim to want me, but still..."

Hot tears run down her cheeks. In the moment, you're sure it would kill you to hide anything from her. So... you tell her the truth.

"I've been waiting for you since our reunion. Secretly, I always hoped you'd give up on the faith, and I'd be able to hold you, honestly and openly..."

"But now... that moment is finally here, and I can't trust it..." $v31_Name reaches you. She holds your face in her hands and rubs at your tears. "What am I supposed to do?!"

You sob into $v31_Name's neck, and she holds you tight. She gently kisses the top of your head while you let it all out... Then, when you fall quiet, she kisses you and sighs against you.

"Fine." You blink up to her, and she blushes as she continues. "I'll convince you. Whatever it takes, I'll show you I'm serious." You relax into her embrace and grin.

"I'd like that... Please do that." Then, as she watches over you and smiles, you feel yourself blushing just like her. You take refuge, hiding your face in her shoulder. "I'm not sure when you got so cool, anyway..."

"Not that I hate it, or anything..."

$v31_Name laughs, and she kisses you. The two of you get quite comfortable in the minimal furnishings of your cage. [[She clutches you tight against her chest until long after you fall asleep|31Hub]].

<<link "\"I'm afraid the depth of what I want will be too much... Can you swear you'll tell me if it is?\"">><<replace "#options">><<set $v31_Attune += 25>>\
"I'm afraid the depth of what I want will be too much... Can you swear you'll tell me if it is?" She presses more frantic kisses, trailing from your lips to your cheek as she grins and nods. When she needs a breather, $v31_Name leans against you and whispers.

"I got some coaching from Agares on that one..." You sulk at the idea, but she appeases you with a quick smooch. "If it's truly too much for me... I'll tell you... 'cardamom'."

You look her over for a moment... Then you snicker. This time she pouts, and you're all too happy to appease her.

"That woman has put some strange things in your head... but it'll work."

Then, you lean forwards and topple $v31_Name to the floor beneath you. She shudders and leans in when you kiss her neck, but with your wrists still bound, you have to ask her so-sweetly to pull her gown over her head. When you see what's underneath, you laugh.

"How in the hells did you source such frilly, precious underwear out of a hole in the middle of the forest?" She blushes and evades your gaze.

You tease her lower in response, creeping down, kissing her chest and stomach before biting down around a tiny, satin ribbon on her bra and pulling gently. $v31_Name whimpers your name and squirms under you. When you curl your fingers to stroke the small of her back, she whines and blurts out.

"I-I brought it with me!" Even she seems shocked that she's said it. You nestle yourself into her chest. Any time she clams up, you scrape your teeth along the curve of her breast and make her shiver beneath you.

"I always do!" You cinch your arms around her hips and squeeze. She cries out, and you can't stop yourself from laughing. Without any prompting, she starts pathetically thrusting her hip against nothing, and she blubbers out more.

"Every time we leave town, I pack some of this stuff, just in case you might see it..." Her arms flail around needing purpose, so you bring your face back up to hers. She plays with your cheeks, runs her fingers through your hair, then clutches desperately at your shoulders. Between bouts of slow, messy kisses, you goad her on.

"Wow... so if I ever turned around when we were changing together, I'd have seen you just like this?" $v31_Name shudders, then nods furiously, pulling a hand over her eyes. You lean in and give her ring finger a sharp bite, forcing her to jerk the hand away and look you in the eyes. "I was worried that witch had changed you, but... you've been this slutty all along, haven't you?"

Tears form in $v31_Name's eyes, and she nods and whimpers and unconsolably apologizes as her whole body shudders. You can't give her a hand, so you wedge your knee between her legs. She wastes no time grinding against you, finding the perfect angle to strike her clit against it. All you do then is sit back and enjoy the adorable moans she makes into your mouth as she rubs herself silly on you.

It doesn't take long before her breath hitches and the full length of her body trembles underneath you. Her arms and legs both spasm, and she wraps them tight around your back. With what little motion you can control, you grind your knee into her, giving her a slow, gentle comedown from that high.

Her cries taper off slowly... then stop, leaving her panting and weak beneath you. $v31_Name pulls you tight against her, and you roll to her side, so she can lean against you. The two of you embrace there, on the floor of your cage. She gazes up into your eyes and mouths some hoarse and breathless words your way.

You think you hear $v31_Name whispering: "Do you understand me now... Iris?"

Her breathing goes slow and rhythmic. You brush her hair from her forehead and lean down to kiss her sleeping face.

"Gods, I hope I do..." [[And you hold her tight to you, joining her in sleep soon after.|31Hub]]

<<set $v31_LastSession to "Lust">>
:: 31Gluttony [Blood]
<<set $v31_didGlut to true>>\
You're woken from your boredom by heavy footfalls in the hallway outside your room. 

$v31_Name enters, and a stream of minions follow in her wake, skeletons and slimes hoisting heavy pots, pans, and even a whole table.

She settles down out of their way and wipes sweat from her forehead, sighing. Then, her gaze meet yours.<<if $v31_Day == 3>> She frowns... and you speak first.

<<include [[31IncludePart3]]>> $v31_Name nods politely and leads a skeleton towards your cage, which she opens.
<<elseif $v31_Day == 4>>.. then drops to her feet.

<<include [[31IncludePart4]]>> At a signal from Agares, $v31_Name opens your cage to make way for her helpers.
<<else>> She smiles.

Agares follows soon after, pulling aside a slime to bark some additional orders its way. $v31_Name opens your cage and directs the crew inside.<</if>>

The minions get to work, preparing a table with two settings, a large stockpot, and a heavy, lacquered keg. A polite slime ushers you to your seat across from $v31_Name, and you're relieved to finally get off the floor. Agares smirks at the two of you, with her usual self-important air strong as ever.

"I hope you know I've put a lot of work into this trial, my pet..." She turns towards $v31_Name and bows her head slightly. "As has Seire." You look her way, and she blushes.

"For this trial, I've put peerless research towards determining the meal most apt to tempt you into Her embrace." At her cue, a halfpint moraxite hops onto your table. He pulls the lid off the stockpot and hangs it off his horn with a bow.

Inside, you spot a familiar reddish broth, and you're struck by a pang of nostalgia. Once that subsides, you glare out towards Agares. She cackles.

"It's safe, I swear it. But, I'm getting ahead of myself, check the drink as well." You take a flagon and pull it towards the keg, only to be interrupted by your ever-polite maÃ®tre d'emon, who fills it in your stead and returns it. From your first sip, you can recognize the watered-down, smoky ale served down the street from your childhood home. A serving slime inches a dainty ramekin of candied juniper berries towards you, but you pop a single one below your tongue before waving it away.

All the familiar scents and flavors overwhelm you and leave you off kilter. $v31_Name tries to serve herself despite the minion's pleas, and Agares watches you, tittering and wagging her tail like she's ''so'' damn pleased with herself. You snarl her way.

"Y'want me to scream every time you know something about me? I've never met such a needy witch in all my days..." She titters, and you continue.

"So what? You hit a caravan and stole their foodstocks. Is that supposed to give me a crisis of faith?" Agares and $v31_Name both stare at you... then the witch shakes her head.

"That's where you're mistaken, my pet. That drink was a gift from a benefactor." She smirks. "As for the meal..." The witch turns to $v31_Name, and you follow her gaze. $v31_Name's eyes go wide, then she blushes and nods.

Agares titters at this, before leaning back with a sigh.

"I'll say, mutt, she's quite the skilled hand at it. She'd have made quite the good wife... if I hadn't intervened, at least."

$v31_Name stands and marches out of the cage, pushing the witch towards the entrance. Agares quickly shouts back your way.

"You can thank me for that later! Make sure to indulge, pup!" And the door slams behind her.

$v31_Name crosses back into the cage and sits across from you, flushed and quiet. Then, she coughs and mutters out.

"Sorry for her... She finds a way to ruin everything, huh?" You snort as you stick your bowl out towards your demonic attendant. He happily deposits a few ladles of soup within it, and you drop a clump of minced garlic into it.

"Oh don't give her the satisfaction. We can at least enjoy a nice meal." She watches you for a moment... then she smiles and nods.

$v31_Name rearranges a decadent number of bowls around the table, scooping heaping spoons of caramalized onions, cream, ginger, dried valafeto, lamb, and pickled mushroom into her bowl. Your stomach hurts a bit just watching her... Then, without making any note of it, she slides you two bowls, with halved quail eggs and raw mushroom. When you don't immediately take them, she looks up and cocks her head at you.

"You take your //renkash// with eggs but never pickled mushroom, right?"

Her innocent gaze catches you off guard, and you blush, quickly thanking her and scooping in a reasonable portion. What you ''don't'' tell her is that you acquired a taste for pickled mushrooms when she was away in Seminary. Instead, you stir up your bowl and take one, divine mouthful with a bit of everything.

As expected, it's the best renkash of your adult life. You catch $v31_Name staring at you as you savor it, but any time you catch her in the act, she only blushes and takes a tiny sip of her drink. By the time you finish your first helping, she's managed to put away about half her bowl of sensory overload.

While the army of evil fixes your second, you stretch and watch $v31_Name as she takes measured attacks at her food, always pairing together different ingredients and reacting differently each time. Seeing all her varied, cute faces, you feel a pang of jealousy... as little sense as it makes... and you get a strange idea, for which you bark some requests at the nearest skeleton.

You circle over to $v31_Name's side of the table as gracefully as possible in your restraints, and she watches you with interest as you do. An attendant steps in to lay a mortar of those candied juniper berries on the table for you, with a heavy wooden spoon. You gesture towards $v31_Name's drained tankard, and she passes it to you. You refill it and set it down. With the wooden spoon, you crush down the berries into a sugary, vibrant slush, of which you scoop a small portion into her drink. The beer fizzes up in rage, and you stir it around into a dull blue homogeny.

You slide it towards $v31_Name, and she peers into the cup before turning back to eye you suspiciously. You laugh and wave her off.

"It's... well..." Thinking back, it never got a proper name. "It's like an 'Aliki's Handshake', but without all the expensive liquors and tonics." 

"Basically, back when the harpy job left you and Nerses wounded, we had to cut back. So, Ruomila was looking for ways to make some of their favorite drinks on a budget. They showed me a bunch of them, but this is the only one that stuck."

$v31_Name wafts the scent of the drink into her nose and appears to analyze it. She looks back to you.

"Is it good?" You laugh and nod. With that, she lifts her tankard and takes a small, apprehensive sip, holding the drink in her mouth to savor it. Then, she smiles.

"It's incredible. They might be a genius after all..." The two of you laugh, but you can't help feeling a little let down. You don't necessarily //try// to pout, but you can feel yourself frowning as you stare out over the remaining spread.

Then, $v31_Name's fingers brush over your scalp, and she whispers up to you.

"Y-you're incredible too, Iris... So good..." You don't dare to move... so she continues. "You're so sweet to me... I just need you to keep looking at me or I might die..." Your whole body shudders. Then, you notice something strange about her words...

"Wait, did you think I was getting jealous of ''the drink'', orâ€”" And when you look back, you notice that $v31_Name has already drained the entire cup, and her entire face is flushed. She whispers an apology up towards you.

"It was really sweet, s-so... I could drink it easier." When you sigh, she leans hard against you and stammers out an apology. "S-sorry... I'm a bad girl... You can punish me, if that'd help..."

You call for the serving staff, but they've chosen //now// to give the two of you some privacy, probably in expectation of an act of Lust. Instead, you pull $v31_Name into your chest and pet her head in an attempt to calm her down. She's all too happy to accept this.

"Idiot... You didn't do anything wrong. I'll get those freaks to bring you some water, but... you need to be more careful in the future..." She starts to shake against you, and, fearing that you've hurt her feelings, you coo over her and stroke her hair. She sighs and leans into your touch. Then, a glassy-eyed $v31_Name stares up at you and whispers.

"Iris..." You smile down at her. "You..." She blinks a few times. "You... really shouldn't wear armor with such a beautiful, pillowy chest... it's a w-waste..."

You groan, and you finally catch the attention of one of Agares's lanky skeletons. It bows to you, and you lead $v31_Name over by the hand before barking an order.

"<<if $attunement > 75>>In Her name.<<else>>Thank the gods.<</if>> Please, take her back to the witch before I do something unethical." And it leads her off, holding her up by the shoulder. $v31_Name grins back at you as she steps out, [[and you blush.|31Hub]] <<set $v31_Attune += 15>>

<<set $v31_didSlot to true>>\
$v31_Name steps through your door late into the evening, with a fashionable nightdress on and a hefty bag in tow.

She crosses to your side immediately, crouching down with a smile.

"So, for $v31_today's trial of Sloth, it'll only be me. Agares said her presence would be too stimulating and you'd never relax..." You nod, and she lets herself into your cage, where she retrievs and lays out a plush blanket and pillow. After so long in the dirt, you don't complain when she asks you to lay there. Pleasant warmth radiates out from them both, and the pillow has a relaxing, floral perfume soaked into it.

As you get comfortable, $v31_Name flits around your cell, tidying bits of debris, leftover food scraps, and remnants from the witch's experiments. Even trapped in a windowless dungeon, it's embarrassing having her clean up after you... so you try to wave her away.

"There's really no need for you to do that." She turns and cocks her head your way, and you continue. "If you really want this place clean, at least let me help. You'd be here for years, otherwise."

$v31_Name giggles, and she crouches down at your side.

"If you don't like it, I can stop, but I can't permit you to help me." You scoff, but $v31_Name only smiles back.

"After all... $v31_today is all about me spoiling you. That means any time you feel yourself drifting off, you're free to <<if $v31_Day % 2 == 1>>nap as long as you like<<else>>turn in for the night<</if>> without any judgement."

She reaches down and strokes your head. Without intending to, you make an embarrassing noise. $v31_Name doesn't acknowledge it, but she pets you more aggressively. You pout.

<span id="options">\
<<link "Pull her down to your side.">><<replace "#options">><<set $v31_Attune += 5>>\
You grab $v31_Name by the wrist, and she falls forward onto you, where you loop your cuffed arms around her. She blubbers and resists, but you just squeeze her tight.

"If you want me to relax, isn't this the most obvious way?" Her eyes go wide, and slowly, certainly, she relaxes into your arms, nestling into the curve of your shoulder. Her breath tickles your neck as she whispers.

"I had other ideas, but... if this is what you want, I'll allow it." She holds you tight, and you giggle. The two of you have to snuggle in close together to fit under your only blanket, not that either of you mind. You're perfectly content to lay with $v31_Name, listening to the cute, sleepy noises she makes as she drifts off ahead of you. Her slow, soft snores bring back memories, and you can't help but lean in to kiss her on the forehead.

"You did good today, $v31_Name. <<if $v31_Day % 2 == 1>>Go easy on me tonight, okay?<<else>>Let's both do our best tomorrow, too.<</if>>"

[[And not long after, you follow her.|31Hub]]
\<</replace>><</link>>
<<link "Lean into her touch.">><<replace "#options">><<set $v31_Attune += 25>>\
Her touch is so soothing that you can't help but lean into it. She notices instantly and reaches in with her free hand to scratch under your chin. As embarrassed as you are, you can't deny the warm, tingly feelings dripping down from your head.

$v31_Name leans down and kisses your flushed cheek.

"You're a pearl, Iris..." You try to hide your embarrassed face, but she only has to massage your scalp for a moment to melt you back into her hands. You're caught in a daze, quiet save for whimpers and shivering under her touch. She knows it, and she delights in it.

Then, right as you're getting used to this sort of touch, $v31_Name settles down beside you and, in one swift motion, lifts your head into her lap. The sudden rush of bodily warmth sends a shudder down your spine. You want to complain or resist, but all the thoughts melt into warm putty any time her skin brushes against your own.

Any adjustment to your position comes with its own issues. Laying still means watching her cute, doting faces as she plays with you and showing your own embarrassing expression in turn. Turning towards her hides your face, but it does so by squishing it directy into her soft, welcoming stomach, an act which makes $v31_Name sigh and rub her legs together. It feels clever to turn away from her, but that only lasts until she strokes the back of your neck, and you let out a shameful, surprised yelp.

No matter what you do, you're totally enveloped in her affection. You can pinpoint the moment when you start letting her take control, but before long, you're totally at her mercy.

$v31_Name caresses you, and you relax into her, letting the soft warmth of her touch wash over you and lull you into sleep. [[The last thing you remember is her shy expression as she leans down to kiss you.|31Hub]]

With a flash of light and an incantation, you shatter your restraints and face Agares head on. She scoffs.

"It seems no matter how willing the pet, they always misbehave eventually... What a shame." And she charges towards you.

$v31_Name intercepts, clotheslining the witch and coming down after her. There's a glint in the dim light as $v31_Name brings down a ritual dagger, stashed underneath her dress. It connects to Agares's abdomen, leaving a horrible gash where she pulls it out.

"You won't lay a finger on her." She raises the blade again. "Do what you like to me, but I won't let you harm..." She freezes up for a moment, then her expression hardens. "I won't let you hold the one I hold most dear!" She thrusts down, but her moment of hesitation costs her everything.

Agares dissolves into a swarm of moths, causing $v31_Name to tumble to the floor and drop her knife. When the witch reappears, she's at your side, with a clawed hand around your throat. Between sputters and gasps for air, she laughs.

"Seriously? 'The one you hold dear'? In Her name..." She incessantly giggles as she hoists you into the air, pressing down hard on your windpipe. You try to force out the words, but even the simple incantations you'd need to free yourself are beyond you like this. "At least now I can see why Her teachings failed on you, //Seire//."

$v31_Name coughs and pulls herself to her feet, leaning on the wall for support. The witch continues berating her.

"This is what I get for taking a charity case. Honestly..." She eyes you, and you writhe and kick at her, to no avail. "This one... she's not much of a looker, but she makes a perfectly suitable mutt. What does she see in a frigid robot like you?"

The edges of your vision are going dark, but you see her, see $v31_Name launching at Agares and being beat down over and over again. Now that the witch is setting the tempo, she's powerless, and you don't have long until you lose consciousness.

You can't cast anything, your abuse here has left you too frail to fight back, and $v31_Name won't last much longer. Then... when she wipes a streak of blood from her cut forehead... you remember a technique you learned long ago, and you're struck by an incredibly cruel plan, the only type you can count on in the moment.

$v31_Name stands and brandishes her knife, and you turn to face her. You mouth three words you've never been able to say to her, and you can tell the instant she reads them properly.

<svg width="25%" viewBox="0 0 160 28"><text x=0 y=20 font-size=12pt fill=none stroke="#071952" stroke-width=0.50>I... love... you.</text></svg>

She wails and charges forward with an awful expression. In this moment, $v31_Name is totally blinded by rage, so you extend your hand... and she slashes it wide open...

The spraying blood speckles Agares's face. In the next instant, she blinks it away while you pour every drop of power you can muster into your focus. Then, you pass it into your wounded hand, and you weakly thrust it into the witch's face. She flinches for a moment, but when nothing happens, she settles down and smirks at you.

"Nice try, mutt, butâ€”" Then, the crystal at the center of your focus lets of a faint glow. That light refracts through your sorcerous blood, and it amplifies thousands and thousands of times over. Blinding, multicolored light fills every corner of the room. 

Agares drops you, clutching at her face, and you land hard with your focus clattering to the floor inches away. You sweep your arm until you can find it and raise it aloft. By the time you can fill your lungs again, the witch has realized your trick. She spots you in an instant and leaps towards you, and...

You incant.

Darts of lightning manifest behind your head, and they rain down upon Agares. After the first volley stuns her, you go again. Then again. Then again. Then again until long after she stops moving, when your voice goes hoarse and you sink back to the floor.

A dazed $v31_Name pushes herself up and crawls to your side, where she cradles your head in her hands and whimpers.

"Iris!" Her tears run freely now, and they drip down onto your cheeks.

With significant effort, you're able to croak out a "Sorry..." as you fumble around to take her hand.

She bends down and weeps into your neck, and you wrap an arm around her. Once you've finally regained your voice, you whisper up to her.

"Are you okay?" $v31_Name pulls back and nods, with her eyes already swollen and red. You pull her down against your chest, where she happily hides her face, and you stroke the back of her head with a sigh. <<if $v31_Attune < 75>>"Thank the gods. Thank the gods..."<<else>>"In Her name. In Her name..."<</if>> She glances up at you.

"B-but... this is all my fault... I brought you here, and..." She tries to push herself off of you, but you cling on tighter. "Iris, I'm serious!"

You lean down and kiss the crown of her head.

"So am I. I told you I forgave you for that, didn't I...?" She gives in and sulks, resting on your chest. "Besides... even if it was your fault, I'd still want to be with you. I meant what I told you..."

"I love you, $v31_Name..." She blushes and tries to hide her troubled face, which you don't allow. You wait while she stammers and blushes, trying to get out a response... Then you lean in and kiss her. She responds to //that// easily, relaxing into you and sighing.

When you pull back, she's got a shaky, blissed-out grin across her flushed face. You can't help but snicker to yourself.

"You know, $v31_Name... You're really honest, in your own ways..."

And she lets you kiss her again. And a few times after that. Eventually, though, you realize you have better places to flirt than the muddy dungeon floor of a dead witch, so you lean against her, [[and she leads you out into the woods|30Days]].

"Listen, Lily, about earlier..." She stares you down as you struggle with your words... Then she shakes her head.

"It's Seire... but... That's not important right now." $v31_Name crouches down to level with you. "I think it'd be best if we took some time to clear our heads, okay?" You gulp. She tries a 'reassuring' smile, but it doesn't help your nerves.

"I know you don't harbor any ill will towards me, Iris. All I want is for you to understand that I'm doing this of my own volition."

You sigh.

"That doesn't make sense to me. All these years, you've told me the church gave you peace, a purpose, everything... and I'm supposed to believe that all of that changed because of some witch?"

She takes a few moments to pace the room. While she does, Agares enters behind her, and you flinch. You expect her to lash out at you, punish you, or, worse, punish $v31_Name... but she doesn't. The witch just walks around the edge of the room, gathering her implements. 

$v31_Name sighs.

"I get that it sounds strange. Please, just take some time to think about what I'm going through, okay?" You nod, and $v31_Name draws in close. She whispers to you, just low enough that the witch might not hear.

"Agares and I may not agree on everything... but, if her methods can really bring those feelings out from within you... maybe then you'll understand." You shiver... and $v31_Name steps back.

"Now... I believe it's about time we get started."

"Sorry... You probably don't want to see me right now..." She eyes you tentatively then sighs and adds, "Or maybe you'd be mad if I didn't show..."

$v31_Name crosses to the room's center, but she doesn't step any closer nor look at you after that.

"The distance between us used to be so clear... but now I don't know how to act around you. I'm trying to stay upset with you, but this morning... <<if $v31_LastSession == "Lust">>You kissed me, like it was nothing.<<elseif $v31_LastSession == "Gluttony">>You were so excited to eat my cooking again.<<elseif $v31_LastSession == "Greed">>We drank together... and it all felt so normal.<<elseif $v31_LastSession == "Sloth">>You laid beside me, just like we used to.<<elseif $v31_LastSession == "Wrath">>You went along with my wishes, just because I was the one asking.<<elseif $v31_LastSession == "Envy">>You tied my ribbon back on and calmed me down, as if I hadn't just done something awful to you.<<elseif $v31_LastSession == "Pride">>We reminisced on the old days, like nothing had changed at all.<</if>>" You stare up to watch her conflicted face, and you feel yourself sighing as well.

"I understand." Her shoulders droop. "That's a normal reaction, I think..." $v31_Name groans and crouches to the floor, perching with her elbows atop her knees.

"Don't console me from within that cage. It feels wrong." You laugh, and she finally shoots you a brief, pouty look.

"Sorry, I wasn't trying to do that. I just meant that I feel the same." She sighs. Her cute, thoughtful expression draws your eye without trying. From it alone, you're sure some of the old Lily is still within her. You continue. "I was ''furious'' then, when I thought the witch was controlling you. But now... I'm not sure what I believe." $v31_Name frowns.

Then, without either of you noticing her arrival, Agares steps forward and gives $v31_Name a light slap on the back, which sends her toppling forward in shock. Agares looks down at her and laughs.

"Honestly, Seire... Weren't you supposed to be moving past all these dreadful feelings?" She rights herself but doesn't meet the witch's gaze. "The All-Mother tells us to enjoy the fruits of life she gave us. She'll get mad if you waste all your time sulking."

$v31_Name sits up straight and bows her head towards Agares, who scoffs.

"I'm not the one you should be talking to." She looks your way, and you instinctively turn away. She sighs. "Go. Kiss and make up so we can get to our work" 

Your eyes meet $v31_Name's, and you look away. While you do, she stands and crosses the room to sit in front of you. She reaches through the bars of your cage to take your hand in hers.

"She's right." $v31_Name sighs... then squeezes your hand. "I'm sorry, Iris."

"You were worried for me, and I just projected my struggles onto you instead of genuinely hearing you out." She smiles softly your way.

"I know things can't be the same again... but I don't want to lose you. Can we settle this?"

$v31_Name has a determined look about her, more than you've ever seen from her in your thirty-some years at her side. She really has changed.

There's no need to give it any more thought than that. You squeeze her hand and nod.

"I think I've already forgiven you... but... I'd still like to talk." At the corner of the room, Agares taps her foot and waits with all her tools.

"But... maybe we'll have to save that for the morning." $v31_Name whirls around, spots Agares, and sighs. She turns back your way and nods.

"Guess so... You're sure you're still up for this?" You nod, and her expression towards you softens. She leans down, hovering her face near your cage, and you mirror her without a thought. Then, she darts forward into a quick, shy kiss, before quickly fleeing back across the room..

While you're in shock, she bows in a brief apology to Agares, and not long after, the experiment proceeds as planned.
