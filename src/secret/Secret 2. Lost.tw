<h3 style = "margin-bottom: -20px">Secret Bonus 2: Cutting Room Floor</h3>

A huge chunk of time spent writing any one of these stories was into research and setting specifics, with the exact balance changing across genres. So, just to get some of these things out there, I've bundled them up here. If you've done enough reading to unlock this bonus, there'll hopefully be something in here you find at least neat.

(Stories will appear below as you finish them.)

Most of this one made it in, but mostly in one, specific, randomized section. A shocking amount of these details come from the specifics of Carina's stupid gacha game, Goldstar Rising. 

One response mentions her "Revolution of the Heavenly Bodies" tier subscription. This is actually a premium second tier to the game's mandatory Battle Pass Progression. The lower tier, "Exalted Rebirth" is much more affordable, and Carina originally joked that Ruby's kid brother must be an ER player based on how she described him. She's the worst.

Two currencies also get shouted out, which are 'Avaricious Fragments' and 'Twisted Genesis', of which the prior are used to buy the former to make pulls. If this sounds convoluted, please know I modeled this after my actual gacha addiction of ~5 years ago.

Also, Ruby's real name is Marike, and (there is no serious-sounding way to put this) the 'mayor' that Sema meets with is, in fact, NYC mayor (at time of writing) Eric Adams. Whether this comes before or after his other alleged backroom dealings with Turkish moguls, I leave as an exercise to the reader. As the preeminent scholar said, all my haters become my waiters at the table of success.

<<linkappend "26. Service">>

As mentioned in the previous bonus, this story originally had an entire extra love interest for poly week. The story just wrapped itself into too cute a little bow to add anything extraneous.

In the original brief, Radia's suitor, Cruz, was present. They had a planned sort of 'helpful political marriage' vibe with Radia, where the two bonded over both being really into Eun. While Radia cared for Eun from all their time together, Cruz comes from nobility under a Materials Engineering megacorp, PolyC Ltd. (Kinda like //PolyC//arbonate : //Policy// : //Poly//-C) and has a fixation on androids. They'd also serve as a vector to get a little deeper Eun's whole deal.

On that:

Eun is a repurposed ''E''xtinction ''Un''it, fit with an Enforcer to wrest Anima from the user's enemies. It ended up in a scrapyard, where Radia found and saved it with her previous maid. Since then, she's added a series of modifications to it (including the bit of squishable chest depicted in the story, and all sorts of sensory gizmos). Over the years, Radia has tried to dress it up in all sorts of fancy outfits, but it prefers the original, quite modest maid outfit. Also, it's name is written with the hanja for 'mercy' (ÊÅ©).

Radia is another blueblood, as the second in lines to the WINGS media corp, but she's been ill since her birth, requiring daily Anima injections. The effects can be... volatile... and she's still quite weak otherwise. Eun tries to keep her exercising and going out, but it's never easy. When she doesn't have the energy for much else, she's got a natural talent for technical painting, which is why she originally found Eun.
